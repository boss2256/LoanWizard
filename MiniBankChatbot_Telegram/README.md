# MiniBankChatbot_Telegram

This is a simple Telegram bot that handles home loan inquiries and bank applications. It's built using the `python-telegram-bot` library.

## Getting Started

To get this bot up and running, follow these easy steps:

**1. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

   -  Using a virtual environment helps isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python installations. Here's how to create one:

     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```

   -  Activate the virtual environment:

     **Windows:**
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

     **macOS and Linux:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

**2. Install Dependencies:**

   -  Once your virtual environment is activated, install the required packages using pip:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

     The `requirements.txt` file should list all the necessary libraries for the bot to function.

**3. Obtain and Configure Your Bot Token:**

   -  To connect your bot to Telegram, you'll need a unique bot token. Visit the Telegram BotFather (https://core.telegram.org/widgets/login) and follow the on-screen instructions to create a bot. The BotFather will provide you with a token.

   -  Create a file named `config.py` in your project directory. Paste your bot token into this file like so:

     ```python
     TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = 'your-bot-token-here'
     ```

**4. Run the Bot:**

   -  With everything set up, start the bot by running the main script:

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

This should get your MiniBankChatbot running on Telegram!
